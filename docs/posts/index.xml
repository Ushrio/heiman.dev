      <description>A personal website is a concept that I have been throwing around in my head for a while now. It has always been a concept that I have been interested in, but I have yet to take the dive till now. I think the greatest accomplishment of a personal website is the idea that it represents a canvas for your ideas. You can do whatever and post whatever you want onto a personal website.</description>
